# PYAADD
Implementation of Affine Arithmetic Decision Diagrams and Affine Binary Decision Diagrams in python.
The formal smeantics and idea is from "Symbolic simulation of SystemC AMS without yet another compiler" by Zivkovic et al. . There is an implementaion of these in Kotlin but the idea is to procide the data type 
and the resulting functionality to a more scientific and applicatino focused software environment.
